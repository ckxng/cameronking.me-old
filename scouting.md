same time in 2019. We send little things back and forth, like letters and
Christmas cards.

Organization of the Scouting Movement, and the three National Service
Organizations for Scouting in North America (Canada/USA/Mexico), are joininly
hosting the event at Summit Bechtel Reserve in West Virginia. I attended as a

I am a Ham Radio operator and for the past several years have made it a point
to bring Jamboree-on-the-Air/Jamboree-on-the-Internet activities to the local
Cub Scout packs where I am active.  We have done HF and satellite radio
activities at Camp Wisdom, and this year we will be using a DMR hotspot and a
two laptops to host a local event (where we can more carefully clean and
control the area, due to COVID concerns).
