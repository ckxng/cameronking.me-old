# 24th World Scout Jamboree

Did I give you a blue and yellow contact card?  If so, you found the 
right place!

This year marks the [24th World Jamboree](https://www.2019wsj.org/).
WSJ is organized by the 
[World Organization of the Scouting Movement](https://www.scout.org/),
and the three National Service Organizations for Scouting in North America
([Canada](https://www.scouts.ca)/[USA](https://www.scouting.org)/[Mexico](http://scouts.org.mx)),
are joininly hosting the event at 
[Summit Bechtel Reserve](https://www.summitbsa.org/) in 
[West Virginia](https://www.wv.gov).  I will be attending as a member 
of the International Service Team working in Emergency Management.

I am `cameron.king` on JamboChat and USA contingent members can contact me 
through the contingent app.  If I gave you a card, that card also includes
my email address.
