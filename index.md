I am a family-man and tinkerer. The best hobbies are the ones that I can do
with my family. I look for simple, practical solutions when possible. I also
sometimes write code and post it to GitHub.

I don't post much on social media, but if you do then you can contact me
via. the following services:

- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/cameroncking (personal)
- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/cameroncking (professional)

If you wish to send me a secure message, consider starting the
conversation using [Delta Chat](https://delta.chat/), addressing the
message to my email address.  (Any AutoCrypt-enabled email client will
also work, or PGP users may reference key 0x5E07C3F2A883A459.)
