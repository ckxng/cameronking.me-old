title: Social Media

I engage social media in the following ways: as a method for friends of friends to 
initiate communication, and as an assertion of my public identity to those 
who are connected to me through these services.

Like almost all internet-connected members of socienty, my "identity" is public.  
Through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cameroncking), you'll find out where 
I work and what organizations I am affiliated with.  Through 
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/cameroncking), you'll find out who my friends 
and family are.  

Between social media and various public records, I'm easy to find.
So, if you'd like to reach out to me, please do so over one of the these services or
through email.  Though, please be aware that I get a _lot_ of junk mail.  Take care
that your introduction does not look like an unsolicited advertizement.
