title: Social Media
---

From the mid 90's to now, I explored everything from Usenet to Facebook in 
pursuit of new and interesting ways to connect with friends, family, and the
occasional internet stranger.  In the end, I've decided that "broadcast-type"
social media tools just aren't for me.  Those who know me have already heard
some version of my social media speech, and those who don't know me... don't 
care.

Here is how I use social media now: as a method for friends of friends to 
initiate communication, and as an assertion of my public identity to those 
who are connected to me through these services.

My "identity" is public, but my thoughts and preferences are not.  Through 
LinkedIn, you'll find out where I work.  Through Facebook, you'll find out who
my friends and family are.  As a person, I am not hidden.  I am trivially easy
to locate and start a conversation with.  However, if you have an interest in
what I _think_, let's have a real conversation.

If you are familiar with PGP or interested in secure communication, I encourage
you to start with [PGP](/pgp/) or [keybase](https://keybase.io/cameronking).
Otherwise, introduce yourself on either 
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/cameroncking) or 
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cameroncking).  However, I do not login
to these often, so please be patient and ensure your introduction does not look
like spam.
